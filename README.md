# Anderson Decimal Classification

This repository contains a diagram created with Mermaid that visually represents the relationships between different knowledge domains. It also includes a list in which each domain is numbered according to a decimal classification system, called Anderson Decimal Classification (ADC), making it easier to organize and navigate between topics.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a clear and structured graphical representation of how different fields of knowledge are interconnected. The diagrams are written in [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) syntax, which allows easy visualization and integration with many markdown and documentation tools.
